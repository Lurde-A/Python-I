  1. First, let’s take a look at the three lists in script.py:
names stores the names of seven individuals.
estimated_insurance_costs stores the estimated medical insurance costs for the individuals.
actual_insurance_costs stores the actual insurance costs paid by the individuals.
We want to calculate the average insurance cost each person paid. We’ll start by adding up all of the insurance costs.
        names = ["Judith", "Abel", "Tyson", "Martha", "Beverley", "David", "Anabel"]
        estimated_insurance_costs = [1000.0, 2000.0, 3000.0, 4000.0, 5000.0, 6000.0, 7000.0]
        actual_insurance_costs = [1100.0, 2200.0, 3300.0, 4400.0, 5500.0, 6600.0, 7700.0]
        Create a variable total_cost and initialize it to 0.
//
total_cost = 0

  2. Use a for loop to iterate through actual_insurance_costs and add each insurance cost to the variable total_cost
//
total_cost = 0
for cost in actual_insurance_costs:
  total_cost += cost

  3. After the for loop, create a variable called average_cost that stores the total_cost divided by the length of the actual_insurance_costs list.
//
average_cost = total_cost/len(actual_insurance_costs)

  4. Print average_cost with the following message: "Average Insurance Cost: <average_cost> dollars."
//
print("Average Insurance Cost: " +str(average_cost) + " dollars.")

  5. For each individual in names, we want to determine whether their insurance cost is above or below average. Write a for loop with variable i that goes from 0 to len(names).
Note: If you run this loop it will return an error because there is currently no code inside of the loop. We’ll fix this in the next step.
//
for i in range(len(names)):

  6. Inside of the for loop, do the following:
        Create a variable name, which stores names[i].
        Create a variable insurance_cost, which stores actual_insurance_costs[i].
        Print out the insurance cost for each individual, with the following message:
        The insurance cost for <name> is <insurance_cost> dollars.
//
for i in range(len(names)):
  name = names[i]
  insurance_cost = actual_insurance_costs[i]
  print("The insurance cost for " + str(name) + " is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

  7. "Click Save to see the result."  <-- The code is fine. In the Console you can see the insurance costs for each of the seven individuals in names. 
The for loop iterated through the entire list and printed out the insurance cost for each individual.

  8. Inside of the for loop, use if, elif, else statements after the print statement to check whether the insurance cost is above, below, or equal to the average. Print out messages for each case:
        When insurance_cost is higher than the average, print out the following:
        The insurance cost for <name> is above average.

        When insurance_cost is lower than the average, print out the following:
        The insurance cost for <name> is below average.

        Otherwise, print out the following:
        The insurance cost for <name> is equal to the average.
//
for i in range(len(names)):
  name = names[i]
  insurance_cost = actual_insurance_costs[i]
  print("The insurance cost for " + str(name) + " is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")
  if insurance_cost > average_cost:
    print("The insurance cost for " + str(name) + " is above average.")
  elif insurance_cost < average_cost:
    print("The insurance cost for " + str(name) + " is below average.")
  else:
    print("The insurance cost for " + str(name) + " is equal to the average.")

  9. Click “Save” to see the results. You should see messages indicating the insurance cost for each of the seven individuals and where their insurance cost stands relative to the 
average.
//
Done.

  10. If you look closely at actual_insurance_costs and estimated_insurance_costs, you will notice that each of the actual insurance costs are 10% higher than the estimated insurance 
costs. Using a list comprehension, create a new list called updated_estimated_costs, which has each element in estimated_insurance_costs multiplied by 11/10.
//
updated_estimated_costs = [ins_c*11/10 for ins_c in estimated_insurance_costs]

  11. Print updated_estimated_costs. You should see that the list now looks the same as actual_insurance_costs.
//
updated_estimated_costs = [ins_c*11/10 for ins_c in estimated_insurance_costs]
print(updated_estimated_costs)

  12. EXTRAS
  12.1 Convert the first for loop in the code to a while loop.
//
OLD: total_cost = 0
OLD: for cost in actual_insurance_costs:
OLD:   total_cost += cost

UPDATED: total_cost = 0
UPDATED: index=0
UPDATED: while index < len(actual_insurance_costs):
UPDATED:   total_cost += actual_insurance_costs[index]
UPDATED:   index += 1

THE FIRS FOR LOOP MODIFICATION WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS:
i=0
while i < len(names):
  name = names[i]
  insurance_cost = actual_insurance_costs[i]
  print("The insurance cost for " + str(name) + " is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")
  if insurance_cost > average_cost:
    print("The insurance cost for " + str(name) + " is above average.")
  elif insurance_cost < average_cost:
    print("The insurance cost for " + str(name) + " is below average.")
  else:
    print("The insurance cost for " + str(name) + " is equal to the average.")
  i += 1

  12.2 Modify the second for loop so that it also calculates how far above or below the average the estimated insurance cost is.
//
OLD:  for i in range(len(names)):
OLD:    name = names[i]
OLD:    insurance_cost = actual_insurance_costs[i]
OLD:    print("The insurance cost for " + str(name) + " is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")
OLD:    if insurance_cost > average_cost:
OLD:      print("The insurance cost for " + str(name) + " is above average.")
OLD:    elif insurance_cost < average_cost:
OLD:      print("The insurance cost for " + str(name) + " is below average.")
OLD:    else:
OLD:      print("The insurance cost for " + str(name) + " is equal to the average.")

UPDATED:  for i in range(len(names)):
UPDATED:    name = names[i]
UPDATED:    insurance_cost = actual_insurance_costs[i]
UPDATED:    higher_cost = insurance_cost - average_cost
UPDATED:    lower_cost = average_cost - insurance_cost
UPDATED:    print("The insurance cost for " + str(name) + " is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")
UPDATED:    if insurance_cost > average_cost:
UPDATED:      print("The insurance cost for " + str(name) + " is " + str(higher_cost) + " above average.")
UPDATED:    elif insurance_cost < average_cost:
UPDATED:      print("The insurance cost for " + str(name) + " is " + str(lower_cost) + " below the average.")
UPDATED:    else:
UPDATED:      print("The insurance cost for " + str(name) + " is equal to the average.")
