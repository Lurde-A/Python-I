                                FOR LOOPS: INTRODUCTION 
  2.1 Run the code. We should get an IndentationError because the print(game) line is not indented.
board_games = ["Settlers of Catan", "Carcassone", "Power Grid", "Agricola", "Scrabble"]
for game in board_games:
print(game)
//
   () Gives the ERROR: IndentationError: expected an indented block
  2.2 Indent (2 spaces or tab) line 6 so that we don’t get an IndentationError when you run the code. Run the code again!
//
board_games = ["Settlers of Catan", "Carcassone", "Power Grid", "Agricola", "Scrabble"]
for game in board_games:
  print(game)
    () Provides the right answer - LIST OF BOARD GAMES
  2.3 Write a for loop that prints each sport in the list sport_games.
sport_games = ["football", "hockey", "baseball", "cricket"]
//
for sport in sport_games:
  print(sport)
    () Provides a list of all sport games

                                FOR LOOPS: USING RANGE
  3. Use the range() function in a for loop to print() out the provided promise variable five times.
//
for i in range(5):
  print(promise)

                                WHILE LOOPS: INTRODUCTION
  4.1 Examine the while loop from the narrative in your code editor. There are additional print() statements to help visualize the iterations. Run the code to see what happens on 
each iteration of the loop. When you are finished, comment out the example to make space for the rest of the checkpoints. To quickly comment out the code, use your cursor or mouse 
to highlight all the code and press command ⌘ + / on a Mac or CTRL + / on a Windows machine.
# While Loop Walkthrough
count = 0
print("Starting While Loop")
while count <= 3:
  # Loop Body
  # Print if the condition is still true
  print("Loop Iteration - count <= 3 is still true")
  # Print the current value of count 
  print("Count is currently " + str(count))
  # Increment count
  count += 1
  print(" ----- ")
print("While Loop ended")
  4.2 Let’s write a while loop that counts down from 10 to 0(inclusive). Once our loop is finished we will commemorate our accomplishment by printing "We have liftoff!". As we saw in 
the narrative, our key components will be:
  A variable to keep track of the count, and also help our loop eventually stop.
  A condition that our while loop will check on each iteration.
  Several code statements to execute on each iteration of the loop.
  Let’s tackle the first component!
Create a variable named countdown and set the value to 10.
//
countdown = 10
  4.3. Now let’s tackle the actual while loop. Define a while loop that will run while our countdown variable is greater than or equal to zero. On each iteration:
  We should print() the value of the countdown variable.
  We should decrease the value of the countdown variable by 1
  Make sure to only print the value of countdown.
//
countdown = 10
while countdown >= 0:
  print(str(countdown))
  countdown -= 1
  4.4. Now that we have built our loop, let’s commemorate our success by printing "We have liftoff!" after the while loop.
//
countdown = 10
while countdown >= 0:
  print(str(countdown))
  countdown -= 1
print("We have liftoff!")

                                WHILE LOOPS: LISTS
  5.1 First, we will need a variable to represent the length of the list. This will help us know how many times our while loop needs to iterate. Create a variable length and set its 
value to be the length of the list of python_topics
//
python_topics = ["variables", "control flow", "loops", "modules", "classes"]
length = len(python_topics)
  5.2 Next, we will require a variable to compare to our length variable to make sure we are able to implement a condition that eventually allows the loop to stop. Create a variable 
called index and initialize the value to be 0.
//
length = len(python_topics)
index = 0
  5.3 Let’s now build our loop. We want our loop to iterate over the list of python_topics and on each iteration print "I am learning about <element from python_topics>". 
For this loop we will need the following components:
  A condition for our while loop
  A statement in the loop body to print from our condition
  A statement in the loop body to increment our index forward.
//
length = len(python_topics)
index = 0
while index < length:
  print("I am learning about " + python_topics[index])
  index += 1

                                INFINITE LOOPS
  6.1 Suppose we have two lists of students, students_period_A and students_period_B. We want to combine all students into students_period_B. Delete the line causing the infinite 
loop and fix it to accomplish the original goal of combining all students from students_period_A into students_period_B. 
//
students_period_A = ["Alex", "Briana", "Cheri", "Daniele"]
students_period_B = ["Dora", "Minerva", "Alexa", "Obie"]
for student in students_period_A:
  students_period_B.append(student)
  print(students_period_B)

                                LOOPS CONTROL: BREAK
  7.1 You have a list of dog breeds you can adopt, dog_breeds_available_for_adoption. Using a for loop, iterate through the dog_breeds_available_for_adoption list and print() 
out each dog breed. Use the <temporary variable> name of dog_breed in your loop declaration.
    dog_breeds_available_for_adoption = ["french_bulldog", "dalmatian", "shihtzu", "poodle", "collie"]
    dog_breed_I_want = "dalmatian"
//
for dog_breed in dog_breeds_available_for_adoption:
  print(dog_breed)
  7.2 Inside your for loop, after you print each dog breed, check if the current element inside dog_breed is equal to dog_breed_I_want. If so, print "They have the dog I want!"
//
for dog_breed in dog_breeds_available_for_adoption:
  print(dog_breed)
  if dog_breed == dog_breed_I_want:
    print("They have the dog I want!")
  7.3 Add a break statement when your loop has found dog_breed_I_want so that the rest of the list does not need to be checked once we have found our breed.
//
for dog_breed in dog_breeds_available_for_adoption:
  print(dog_breed)
  if dog_breed == dog_breed_I_want:
    print("They have the dog I want!")
    break

                                LOOPS CONTROL: CONTINUE
  8.1 Your computer is the doorman at a bar in a country where the drinking age is 21. Loop through the ages list. If an entry is less than 21, skip it and move to the next entry. 
Otherwise, print() the age. 
ages = [12, 38, 34, 26, 21, 19, 67, 41, 17]
//
for age in ages:
  if age < 21:
    continue
  print(age)

                                NESTED LOOPS
  9.1 We have provided the list sales_data that shows the number of scoops sold for different flavors of ice cream at three different locations: Scoopcademy, Gilberts Creamery, 
and Manny’s Scoop Shop. We want to sum up the total number of scoops sold across all three locations. Start by defining a variable scoops_sold and set it to zero.
sales_data = [[12, 17, 22], [2, 10, 3], [5, 12, 13]]
//
scoops_sold = 0
  9.2 Loop through the sales_data list using the following guidelines: For our temporary variable of the for loop, call it location. print() out each location list.
//
for lacation in sales_data:
  print(lacation)
  9.3 Within our sales_data loop, nest a secondary loop to go through each location sublist element and add the element value to scoops_sold. By the end, you should have the sum 
of every number in the sales_data nested list.
//
sales_data = [[12, 17, 22], [2, 10, 3], [5, 12, 13]]
scoops_sold = 0
for location in sales_data:
#  print(location)
  for money in location:
    scoops_sold += money
  9.4 Print out the value of scoops_sold outside of the nested loop.
//
print(scoops_sold)

                                LIST COMPREHENSIONS: INTRODUCTION
  10.1 We have been provided a list of grades in a physics class. Using a list comprehension, create a new list called scaled_grades that scales the class grades based on the highest 
score. Since the highest score was a 90 we simply want to add 10 points to all the grades in the list. Print scaled_grades.
//
grades = [90, 88, 62, 76, 74, 89, 48, 57]
scaled_grades = [grade+10 for grade in grades]
print(scaled_grades)

                                LIST COMPREHENSIONS: CONDITIONALS
 11.1 We have defined a list heights of visitors to a theme park. In order to ride the Topsy Turvy Tumbletron roller coaster, you need to be above 161 centimeters. Using a list 
comprehension, create a new list called can_ride_coaster that has every element from heights that is greater than 161. Print can_ride_coaster.
//
heights = [161, 164, 156, 144, 158, 170, 163, 163, 157]
can_ride_coaster = [height for height in heights if height > 161]
print(can_ride_coaster)

                                REVIEW
 1. Create a list called single_digits that consists of the numbers 0-9 (inclusive).
//
single_digits = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
 2. Create a for loop that goes through single_digits and prints out each one.
//
single_digits = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
for digit in single_digits:
  print(digit)
 3. Before the loop, create a list called squares. Assign it to be an empty list to begin with.
//
single_digits = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
for digit in single_digits:
  print(digit)
squares=[]
 4. Inside the loop that iterates through single_digits, append the squared value of each element of single_digits to the list squares. You can do this before or after printing the element.
//
single_digits = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
squares=[]
for digit in single_digits:
  print(digit)
  squares.append(digit*digit)
 5. After the for loop, print out squares.
//
single_digits = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
squares=[]
for digit in single_digits:
  print(digit)
  squares.append(digit*digit)
print(squares)
 6. Create the list cubes using a list comprehension on the single_digits list. Each element of cubes should be an element of single_digits taken to the third power.
//
single_digits = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
squares=[]
for digit in single_digits:
  print(digit)
  squares.append(digit*digit)
print(squares)
cubes=[cube**3 for cube in single_digits]
 7. Print cubes.
//
single_digits = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
squares=[]
for digit in single_digits:
  print(digit)
  squares.append(digit*digit)
print(squares)
cubes=[cube**3 for cube in single_digits]
print(cubes)
