# Function to estimate insurance cost:
def estimate_insurance_cost(name, age, sex, bmi, num_of_children, smoker):
  estimated_cost = 250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500
  print(name + "'s Estimated Insurance Cost: " + str(estimated_cost) + " dollars.")
  return estimated_cost
 
# Estimate Maria's insurance cost
maria_insurance_cost = estimate_insurance_cost(name = "Maria", age = 31, sex = 0, bmi = 23.1, num_of_children = 1, smoker = 0)

# Estimate Rohan's insurance cost
rohan_insurance_cost = estimate_insurance_cost(name = 
"Rohan", age = 25, sex = 1, bmi = 28.5, num_of_children = 3, smoker = 0)

# Estimate Valentina's insurance cost
valentina_insurance_cost = estimate_insurance_cost(name = "Valentina", age = 53, sex = 0, bmi = 31.4, num_of_children = 0, smoker = 1)

1. Estimated insurance costs for three individuals – Maria, Rohan, and Valentina:
//
Maria's Estimated Insurance Cost: 4222.0 dollars.
Rohan's Estimated Insurance Cost: 5442.0 dollars.
Valentina's Estimated Insurance Cost: 36368.0 dollars. 

2. We want to compare the estimated insurance costs (as calculated by our function) to the actual amounts that Maria, Rohan, and Valentina paid.
Create a list called names and fill it with the names of the individuals you are estimating insurance costs for:
    "Maria"
    "Rohan"
    "Valentina"
//
names=["Maria", "Rohan", "Valentina"]

3. Next, create a list called insurance_costs and fill it with the actual amounts that Maria, Rohan, and Valentina paid for insurance:
    4150.0
    5320.0
    35210.0
//
insurance_costs=[4150.0, 5320.0, 35210.0]

4. Currently the names and insurance_costs lists are separate, but we want each name to be paired with an insurance cost. Create a new variable called insurance_data that 
combines names and insurance_costs using the zip() function. Print this new variable.
//
insurance_data=zip(names, insurance_costs)
print(insurance_data)

5. This output does not mean much to us. To change it to a format we can actually understand, we must convert the zip object to a list by doing the following:
        list(zip(____, ____))
Convert the insurance_data object to a list using this method. Click “Save” to see the result –  you should now see a list of names and insurance costs.
//
insurance_data=zip(names, insurance_costs)
print(insurance_data)
insurance_data=list(zip(names, insurance_costs))
print(insurance_data)
