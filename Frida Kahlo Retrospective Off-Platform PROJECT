  1. First, create a list called paintings and add the following titles to it: 'The Two Fridas', 'My Dress Hangs Here', 'Tree of Hope', 'Self Portrait With Monkeys'
//
paintings = ['The Two Fridas', 'My Dress Hangs Here', 'Tree of Hope', 'Self Portrait With Monkeys']

  2. Next, create a second list called dates and give it the following values: 1939, 1933, 1946, 1940
//
dates = [1939, 1933, 1946, 1940]

  3. It doesnâ€™t do much good to have the paintings without their dates, and vice versa. Zip together the two lists so that each painting is paired with its date and resave it to 
the paintings variable. Make sure to convert the zipped object into a list using the list() function. Print the results to the terminal to check your work.
